This project is part of The Odin Project's Ruby course. In this assignment, I implemented a method to count occurrences of specified substrings within a given word or phrase. This project helped deepen my understanding of string manipulation, arrays, and hashes in Ruby.

## 📝 Project Objective

The goal was to create a method called substrings that takes a word and an array of valid substrings (dictionary) as arguments. The method returns a hash listing each substring found in the original string and the number of times it was found. This project enhanced my skills in string manipulation and algorithm development.

## 🔧 Features

- Accepts a string input and an array of valid substrings.

- Handles case insensitivity, ensuring accurate substring matching.

- Removes special characters from the input string to focus on words.

- Returns a hash containing each substring found and its corresponding count.

## 📖 Learnings

- **String Manipulation**: Improved my ability to process and clean strings by removing special characters.

- **Array and Hash Operations**: Enhanced my understanding of iterating through arrays and managing hash structures to store results.

- **Case Handling**: Gained experience in handling case insensitivity for accurate matching.

- **Algorithm Development**: Practiced developing an algorithm for counting occurrences in a flexible way, allowing for multiple words.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **Ruby** for implementing the functionality of the substrings method.
